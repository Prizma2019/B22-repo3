few things happened:
 1.it automatically created New Repo
 under ymy github.com account
 2. made a coonection with my local git repo

 Now our work will continue locally:

 1. Add a ne file file called comments.txt
 2.commited the change to local repo
 3. we want this change to be reflected in remote repository
 so we pushed local commit to remote repository using push origin button
 4. Observe it has been added in your repository under GitHub.com
